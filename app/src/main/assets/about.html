<h2>About</h2>

<p>This application is used for adding an additional authentication factor
    to the process of logging into Cryptodash, the desktop application. In most
    cases this is used in addition to a username/password combination. Taken
    together, this is referred to as two-factor authentication because there are
    two independent, separate authentication stages. The first stage is entering a
    username/password combination (the default stage) and the second stage (which this
    application enables) is entering a one-time, 6 digit code. A new code is generated
    every 30 seconds.</p>
